# WeatherHub: Weather Station Data Aggregator

## Project Brief

### Overview
Create a robust Go application that collects, aggregates, and analyzes weather data from multiple sources. The system will provide insights through statistical analysis and make data accessible via both REST API and command-line interfaces.

### Project Goals
- Build a reliable data pipeline for weather information
- Implement efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Provide meaningful analysis of weather trends
- Deliver clean, maintainable, and well-tested Go code

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Collection Service
- Implement clients for multiple weather APIs:
  - OpenWeatherMap
  - WeatherAPI.com
  - National Weather Service API
- Create an extensible interface for adding new data sources
- Handle authentication, rate limiting, and error recovery
- Implement data normalization across different sources

#### 2. Storage Engine
- Use BadgerDB for persistent local storage
- Design efficient schema for time-series weather data
- Implement data compression for long-term storage
- Create data retention policies (hourly data for 7 days, daily aggregates for 1 year)

#### 3. Data Processing
- Calculate statistical aggregates (mean, median, variance)
- Detect anomalies in weather patterns
- Generate daily/weekly/monthly reports
- Implement data validation and quality control

#### 4. API Service
- Create a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/current` - Current weather conditions
  - `/api/v1/forecast` - Weather forecast
  - `/api/v1/historical` - Historical weather data
  - `/api/v1/stats` - Statistical analysis
- Support filtering by location, time period, and data points
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Add rate limiting for API consumers

#### 5. Command Line Interface
- Develop a CLI tool for data querying and system management
- Support commands for data export/import
- Implement interactive mode and batch processing
- Add colorized output for better readability

### Technical Stack
- Language: Go 1.21+
- Storage: BadgerDB
- Configuration: Viper
- CLI Framework: Cobra
- HTTP Router: Chi or Gin
- Testing: Go's built-in testing framework with testify
- Logging: Zap
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Follow standard Go project layout
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement interfaces for core components
- Use context for cancellation and timeouts
- Follow idiomatic Go practices

### Error Handling
- Create custom error types for different failure scenarios
- Implement proper error propagation
- Use error wrapping with additional context
- Add comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain >80% test coverage
- Write unit tests for all packages
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Create benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

### Performance Goals
- API response time <100ms for 95th percentile
- Support for at least 100 requests/second
- Data processing latency <5 seconds for new records
- Support for multiple geographic regions
