# Prompt: Set Up Testing Framework

**Objective:** To install, configure, and initialize a testing framework for the project, ensuring that developers can easily write and run automated tests.

**Context:** This project currently lacks a formal testing framework, making it difficult to verify code quality and prevent regressions. This prompt initiates the one-time setup of a testing environment.

---

### **1. Framework Selection and Planning**

Your first task is to select and plan the setup for a testing framework.

-   **Proposed Framework:** `[Propose a suitable testing framework based on the project's technology stack, e.g., "Jest with React Testing Library," "Pytest," "Mocha & Chai."]`
-   **Reasoning:** `[Briefly explain why the proposed framework is a good choice for this project.]`

Your plan MUST include:
-   **Dependencies:** A list of the required packages to be installed.
-   **Configuration:** A description of the necessary configuration files (e.g., `jest.config.js`, `babel.config.js`) and the settings they will contain.
-   **Directory Structure:** Where test files will be located (e.g., in a `__tests__` directory alongside the source files).

### **2. Installation and Configuration**

Execute the plan:
-   Install all the required dependencies using the project's package manager.
-   Create the necessary configuration files with the correct settings.
-   Add a script to `package.json` (or equivalent) to make it easy to run the tests (e.g., `"test": "jest"`).

### **3. Create an Example Test**

To verify the setup, create a simple "smoke test" for a core component or function. This test should:
-   Be placed in the correct location.
-   Demonstrate the basic testing syntax.
-   Pass when the test runner is executed.

### **4. Documentation**

After the setup is complete and verified, you MUST update the Memory Bank:
-   **`memory-bank/techContext.md`**:
    -   Add a new section detailing the testing framework, its configuration, and how to run tests.
-   **`.clinerules/`**:
    -   Consider creating a new rule file (`testing-standards.md`) that outlines the conventions for writing tests in the project.

### **5. Verification**

Confirm that the testing framework is fully installed, configured, and that the example test runs successfully. The project is now ready for developers to begin writing tests.
