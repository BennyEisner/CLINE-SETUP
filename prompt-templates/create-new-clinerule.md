# Prompt: Create New .clinerule

**Objective:** To create a new, specific `.clinerule` that defines a clear, enforceable standard, convention, or best practice for this project.

**Context:** To maintain code quality and consistency across the project, we need to establish and document our standards as `.clinerules`. This task is to create a new rule that can be easily understood and followed.

---

### **1. Rule Definition**

Your primary task is to define and create a new `.clinerule` file.

-   **Rule Name/Topic:** `[Specify a clear, concise name for the rule]`
-   **File Name:** `[e.g., 03-api-error-handling.md]`
-   **Location:** `.clinerules/`

### **2. Rule Content**

The content of the `.clinerule` markdown file MUST include the following sections:

-   **Title:** A clear, descriptive title for the rule (e.g., `# API Error Handling Standards`).
-   **Principle/Goal:** A brief, high-level statement explaining *why* this rule is important. What is the goal we are trying to achieve with it?
-   **Rule Requirements:** A clear, actionable set of guidelines. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
    -   These should be specific and unambiguous.
-   **Good Example (Do This):**
    -   Provide a concise, correct code snippet that demonstrates the rule being followed properly.
    -   Briefly explain why this example is correct.
-   **Bad Example (Don't Do This):**
    -   Provide a concise code snippet that shows a violation of the rule.
    -   Briefly explain why this example is incorrect.

### **3. Verification**

After creating the file, confirm that the rule is well-defined, the examples are clear, and the documentation is easy to understand for any developer working on this project.
