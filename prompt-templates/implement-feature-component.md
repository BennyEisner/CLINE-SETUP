# Prompt: Implement Feature Component

**Objective:** To implement the logic and UI for a specific, well-defined component that is part of a larger feature.

**Context:** The scaffolding for the parent feature `[Feature Name]` is complete. This task is to build out one of its constituent components.

---

### **1. Implementation Task**

Your task is to implement the `[Specify Component Name]` component.

-   **Component Location:** `[Path to Component File]`
-   **Requirements:**
    -   `[List the specific, granular requirements for this component.]`
    -   `[e.g., "Fetch user data from the `userService`."]`
    -   `[e.g., "Display the user's name and email."]`
    -   `[e.g., "Include a button labeled 'Save Changes'."]`
    -   `[e.g., "The 'Save Changes' button should be disabled until a change is made."]`
    -   `[e.g., "On click, the button should call the `updateUser` method on the service."]`

### **2. Implementation**

Write the necessary code to meet all of the specified requirements. You MUST ensure that your implementation:
-   Follows all project coding standards and `.clinerules`.
-   Aligns with the system patterns documented in `systemPatterns.md`.
-   Includes error handling for operations like API calls.
-   Is accompanied by corresponding unit tests that cover the new logic.

### **3. Documentation and Progress Update**

After the implementation is complete and tested:
-   **Update Memory Bank:**
    -   **`memory-bank/progress.md`**:
        -   Check off the completed task(s) for this component in the feature checklist.
        -   Update the "What Works" section to include the newly implemented functionality.
-   **Code Comments:** Add comments to any complex or non-obvious sections of the code you've written.

### **4. Verification**

Confirm that the component is fully implemented according to the requirements, is well-tested, and that the project's progress has been accurately documented.
