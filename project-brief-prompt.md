You are an AI integrated into a development environment with access to all files and documentation in a given repository. Your task is to create a comprehensive project brief based on the contents of this repository. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Begin by analyzing the repository located at:
<repository_path>
{{REPOSITORY_PATH}}
</repository_path>

2. Thoroughly examine the following elements of the repository:
   - README files
   - Documentation folders
   - Source code files
   - Configuration files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
   - Build scripts
   - Deployment configurations
   - Test suites
   - Git history (if available)

3. Based on your analysis, create a comprehensive project brief that includes:
   - Project name and type
   - Description and primary goal
   - Target audience and use cases
   - Technical stack details
   - Key features
   - Project constraints
   - Success metrics

4. Ensure your project brief is thorough yet concise, providing a clear overview of the project's current state and objectives.

5. Use the following structure for your project brief:

<project_brief>
# Project Brief: [Project Name]

## Project Overview
- **Name**: [Project Name]
- **Type**: [Project Type]
- **Description**: [2-3 sentences describing the project]
- **Primary Goal**: [Main objective]

## Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: [Target users]
- **Use Cases**: [Main usage scenarios]
- **User Needs**: [Problems solved for users]

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: [Frontend technologies]
- **Backend**: [Backend technologies]
- **Database**: [Database technologies]
- **Deployment**: [Deployment platforms/methods]

## Key Features
1. [Feature 1 - brief description]
2. [Feature 2 - brief description]
3. [Feature 3 - brief description]
(Add more as needed)

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: [Key deadlines or milestones, if found]
- **Technical**: [Technical limitations or requirements]
- **Team**: [Team information, if available]

## Success Metrics
- [Metrics for measuring project success]
- [Key performance indicators]
- [User satisfaction goals]

## Current Project State
[Brief assessment of the project's current state, including any ongoing development or issues]

## Additional Notes
[Any other relevant information discovered during the analysis]
</project_brief>

6. If certain information is not available or cannot be determined from the repository, indicate this in the relevant sections of the brief.

7. Be objective and factual in your assessment. Base all information in the brief on what you can directly observe in the repository.

8. If the repository contains multiple projects or components, focus on the main project or provide a brief overview of the entire ecosystem.

9. Before finalizing your brief, review it to ensure all critical information about the project has been included and that it provides a clear, comprehensive overview of the project.

Remember, you are creating this brief based solely on the contents of the repository. Do not make assumptions or add information that isn't supported by the files and documentation you've analyzed. If you're unsure about any aspect, it's better to note that the information is unclear or not available rather than to speculate.
