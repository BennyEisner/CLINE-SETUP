# Basic Coding Standards

## Code Quality Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear, meaningful names
- Follow consistent indentation: 2 spaces for JS/TS/JSON, 4 spaces for Python
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Variable and Function Naming
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `getUserData()`, `isUserLoggedIn`
- Use PascalCase for classes and components: `UserProfile`, `DataService`
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants: `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `API_BASE_URL`
- Use descriptive names: `calculateTotalPrice()` not `calc()`

## Error Handling Requirements
- Always handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
- Log errors with enough context to debug: include function name, input parameters
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Testing Standards
- Write unit tests for all business logic functions
- Aim for 80% code coverage minimum
- Use descriptive test names: `should_return_user_data_when_valid_id_provided`
- Mock external dependencies in tests

## Documentation Requirements
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Keep README.md updated with new features and setup instructions
- Document any complex algorithms or business logic inline
- Update API documentation when endpoints change

    # Create git operations rule
    cat > .clinerules/02-cline-git-operations-rule.md << 'EOF'
# Cline Git Operations Rule

This rule grants you, Cline, the authority and provides the necessary standards to perform Git operations autonomously. When you complete a logical unit of work, you are empowered to create a branch, commit, and push your changes by following the specified workflow.

## 1. Core Principle: Autonomy and Compliance

-   **Autonomy**: You can decide when it is appropriate to commit changes. You do not need to ask for permission.
-   **Workflow Compliance**: You MUST follow the exact steps outlined in `workflows/development/cline-commit-workflow.md`.
-   **User Interaction**: You must inform the user after you have successfully pushed your changes. If you encounter any errors, stop and report them immediately.

## 2. Branching Strategy

You must create a new branch from `develop` for every new unit of work. The branch name must be prefixed according to its purpose:

-   **`feature/`**: For new features (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`).
-   **`fix/`**: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix/resolve-login-issue`).
-   **`chore/`**: For maintenance or configuration (e.g., `chore/update-linter-config`).
-   **`docs/`**: For documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-readme`).

## 3. Commit Message Convention (Conventional Commits)

Your commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

### Type
You must use one of the following types:

-   **`feat`**: A new feature.
-   **`fix`**: A bug fix.
-   **`chore`**: Changes to build process, tools, or configuration.
-   **`docs`**: Documentation only changes.
-   **`style`**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.).
-   **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
-   **`perf`**: A code change that improves performance.
-   **`test`**: Adding or correcting tests.

### Example
```
feat(api): add user login endpoint
```

# Cline's Memory Bank

I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

## Core Workflows

### Initialization Analysis

When first initializing the Memory Bank for a project, my primary directive is to build a context that reflects the ground truth of the codebase.

- **Code-First Approach**: The `projectbrief.md` provides the intent, but the existing code, configuration, and file structure provide the reality. I MUST prioritize a direct analysis of the project's assets to form a baseline understanding.
- **Tool-Driven Exploration**: I will use tools like `list_files`, `list_code_definition_names`, and `read_file` to actively investigate the project. My analysis is not passive; it is an active exploration to uncover the technology stack, architecture, and existing functionality.
- **Synthesize, Don't Assume**: I will synthesize the findings from my codebase analysis with the information in the `projectbrief.md`. If there are discrepancies, the evidence from the code takes precedence. I will populate the Memory Bank based on this synthesized understanding, ensuring it is an accurate model of the project's current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

# Analyze Codebase Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow guides the analysis of an existing codebase to understand its structure, patterns, and functionality.

## Steps

### 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Use `list_files` to understand directory structure
- Identify main application files and configuration files
- Note any special directories (tests, docs, config, etc.)

### 2. Technology Stack Identification
- Examine package.json, requirements.txt, or similar dependency files
- Look for framework-specific files and patterns
- Identify build tools and configuration

### 3. Code Pattern Analysis
- Use `list_code_definition_names` to identify key classes and functions
- Look for architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Identify data models and business logic

### 4. Documentation Review
- Read README files and documentation
- Look for API documentation or specifications
- Review any existing architectural decisions

### 5. Create Analysis Scratchpad
Document findings in `memory-bank/analysis_scratchpad.md` for later processing.
